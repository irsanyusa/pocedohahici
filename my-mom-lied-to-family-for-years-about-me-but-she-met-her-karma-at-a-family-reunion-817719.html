A&nbsp;woman wrote to&nbsp;Reddit with her mildly infuriating story about her relationship with her mom.

She began her post, saying that her mother has always been an&nbsp;evil spirit in&nbsp;her life. The woman described her, saying, “She was literally cancer the 21&nbsp;years&nbsp;I lived at&nbsp;home.”</p><p>The woman continues her story, telling more about her very complicated life with her dearest person, who gave her life. She wrote, “She made my&nbsp;life hell, and because of&nbsp;her&nbsp;I ended up&nbsp;so&nbsp;depressed and stressed out a&nbsp;lot, I&nbsp;was a&nbsp;bit overweight, and she always made fun of&nbsp;me&nbsp;for&nbsp;it. I&nbsp;could never hold down a&nbsp;<a href=# title=job data-link=tag>job</a> when&nbsp;I was younger, because of&nbsp;self-esteem issues and my&nbsp;<a href=# title=depression data-link=tag>depression</a>, but&nbsp;I was constantly called lazy.”</p><p>Then the major event of&nbsp;the woman’s life happened and she could breathe freely. She shared, “At&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;21&nbsp;I moved out, I&nbsp;stayed with friends, worked on&nbsp;my&nbsp;mental and physical health and for myself a&nbsp;decent job.”</p><p>The woman’s self-esteem is&nbsp;also now much better. She shares, “I&nbsp;feel <a href=# title=amazing data-link=tag>amazing</a> now, four years later&nbsp;I have a&nbsp;great friend circle and a&nbsp;boyfriend who fully supports me&nbsp;in&nbsp;any way.”</p><p><h2>The woman found out about her mother’s ill behavior and couldn’t hold up&nbsp;her emotions.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c14/c04/c1735c529eb06390085fed3f68.jpg><p>The woman goes on&nbsp;with her story, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>saying</a>, “I&nbsp;have been in&nbsp;no&nbsp;contact with my&nbsp;mom for the last four years and some <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a>&nbsp;I don’t talk to&nbsp;either, one of&nbsp;the reasons why is&nbsp;because they always took my&nbsp;mom’s side and believed her, because she made me&nbsp;out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;this demon child, but she had no&nbsp;idea how&nbsp;I could be&nbsp;as&nbsp;horrible as&nbsp;I&nbsp;was.”</p><p>The OP&nbsp;has a&nbsp;strong bond with some family members, who supported her. She revealed, “I&nbsp;only speak to&nbsp;my&nbsp;grandparents, who witnessed some things she did to&nbsp;me&nbsp;months before I&nbsp;moved, and cut her off, plus they didn’t want to&nbsp;get into any drama in&nbsp;the family anyway. And a&nbsp;cousin who, being a&nbsp;witness to&nbsp;this when we&nbsp;were younger, was someone who&nbsp;I also stayed in&nbsp;contact with.”</p><p>The woman says that her mom’s lies were absolutely insane. She wrote, “Throughout those four years mom continued to&nbsp;lie about&nbsp;me, I&nbsp;kept putting on&nbsp;weight, I&nbsp;had no&nbsp;job, I&nbsp;was homeless, I&nbsp;tried breaking into her home multiple times, I&nbsp;had offended her, so&nbsp;forth.”</p><p><h2>One day, there was a&nbsp;family gathering, and things were getting tough.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5a3/a55/ac1d0c5ca6b2ee28f1314e554e.jpg><p>The woman continues her story, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>saying</a>, that recently, there was a&nbsp;family event that was absolutely epic for her and a&nbsp;lesson for her mother. She wrote, “But just last month my&nbsp;grandfather reached out and told me&nbsp;that he&nbsp;had heard what my&nbsp;mom had been saying, and told me&nbsp;that they were doing a&nbsp;virtual family reunion in&nbsp;January, I&nbsp;should join in&nbsp;and prove everyone wrong.”</p><p>She adds, “My&nbsp;cousin also told me&nbsp;to&nbsp;sit somewhere in&nbsp;my&nbsp;house where my&nbsp;boyfriend would&nbsp;be, because apparently&nbsp;I still couldn’t get a&nbsp;boyfriend.”</p><p>So&nbsp;the big day arrived, and the woman remembers about it&nbsp;with a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;emotions. She wrote, “I&nbsp;was 5&nbsp;minutes late on&nbsp;purpose, and the look on&nbsp;people’s face was hilarious, that’s when people started questioning my&nbsp;mom, and my&nbsp;mom ignored every question, and made up&nbsp;the excuse that I’d had some ’work’ done.”</p><p>The confrontation started immediately. The woman recalls, “That’s when&nbsp;I said&nbsp;no, this has been me&nbsp;for three years, all the news you were getting on&nbsp;me, was from the woman, who, like a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;you&nbsp;I haven’t spoken to&nbsp;you in&nbsp;years, this woman lied, she has degraded me&nbsp;my&nbsp;whole life, and still does&nbsp;it, because that’s all she can do&nbsp;with her life.”</p><p><h2>And there was a&nbsp;big “surprise”, waiting for the woman’s mother at&nbsp;the end.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fbb/ced/32f50451198aeb33e5cea91115.jpg><p>The woman goes&nbsp;on, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>saying</a>, “That’s when my&nbsp;boyfriend walked into the kitchen and everyone freaked out more when&nbsp;I told them he&nbsp;was my&nbsp;boyfriend, and he&nbsp;gave a&nbsp;friendly wave in&nbsp;the background. My&nbsp;mom literally had a&nbsp;death stare going&nbsp;on.”</p><p>She revealed, “People started questioning my&nbsp;mom again, she didn’t answer anyone, and then said, ’I don’t need to&nbsp;answer anyone’, before she left on&nbsp;her end.”</p><p>The lesson was taken with a&nbsp;big pain from the mother’s side. The woman explained, “Later on&nbsp;I found out from my&nbsp;cousin who heard from her mom, that my&nbsp;mom had a&nbsp;full on&nbsp;meltdown, because&nbsp;I had the audacity to&nbsp;sit in&nbsp;there, and be&nbsp;all smug, and how&nbsp;I should have stayed away because now there are problems within the family, and it’s my&nbsp;fault.”</p><p>“But this only comes back to&nbsp;her being embarrassed and being called out on&nbsp;her lies.”</p><p>And here’s quite the opposite example of&nbsp;a&nbsp;mom, and this time it’s a&nbsp;celebrity family.
