As you explore your yoga practice and try different methods—from hot to vinyasa and more—you’ll need the right gear. One of the most essential is also the most obvious: Yoga pants. While your go-to fitness gear can work for your practice, yoga pants can offer specialized support and compression as you move from downward to upward dog and beyond.&nbsp;</p><p>Here, we tested a variety of yoga pants to help you find your next favorite pair.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=our-top-picks-for-best-yoga-pants>Our top picks for best yoga pants</h2><h3>Best yoga pants with pockets: <a class=affiliate-link-link href=# rel=nofollow>Third Love Kinetic Performance Pocket Leggings</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best Yoga Pants with Phone Pockets</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Third Love Kinetic Performance Pocket Leggings</h3></p><p>A yoga ritual allows you to release the fatigue and tension of the day. And part of that ritual might be commuting with less fuss. If you want to hop out of your apartment to a yoga class with only a phone, key and credit card, these performance leggings from Third Love will be your new go-to. We love the stretchy, breathable material that’s not too thin to see through. The wide selection of colors makes it easy to go bold and bright or stick with neutrals if that’s more your vibe. The high waistband provides slight compression without being too restrictive.&nbsp;</p><p>Keep in mind the pocket is big enough for a few items but not for the entire contents of your purse. Some reviewers shared the crotch area could be expanded to be more comfortable for plus-sized women. Others suggest going slightly smaller than your typical size since the band tends to fall or roll down if it’s too big.&nbsp;</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/f8c5598b4fa1b922b6c37833e0b35ac3/1210b/Third-Love-Kinetic-Performance-Pocket-Leggings.jpg></span></span><h4>Specifications:&nbsp;</h4><ul><li><strong>Sizes</strong>: XS- 3X&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Rise</strong>: High-rise&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Compression</strong>: Lightly compressive fit</li><li><strong>Material/Fabric</strong>: 88% polyester/12% spandex</li><li><strong>Care</strong>: Handwashing is ideal, but you can use a washing machine by placing the pants in a mesh lingerie bag.

If you’re worried about doing a forward fold and showing your underwear, you can be stress-free with these leggings that feature interlock knit fabric that conceals well.&nbsp;</p><p>Though you can wear these leggings year-round, they’re ideal for the colder months since the material is slightly thicker.

Known for its dedication to performance athletes and for creating high-quality clothing that lasts for years, Icebreaker tights will help you expand your practice.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to the high-waist design and elasticized waistband, this yoga pant features flatlock seams and body contouring in the back for an improved fit and feel. A pocket on the right side is also big enough for a phone. When ordering, keep in mind reviews share that they run on the smaller side and are a bit warmer than other lightweight leggings. If you have a pet in the house, try to resist a hug ‘goodbye’ before heading to yoga since some reviewers shared that they can collect hair.&nbsp;</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/3a9b7537f0abf2599d459c9a6ddd53e3/76902/Municipal-Womens-Staple-Legging.jpg></span></span><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li><strong>Sizes</strong>: XS-XL</li><li><strong>Rise</strong>: High-rise</li><li><strong>Compression</strong>: Form-fitting</li><li><strong>Material/Fabric:</strong> 97% Merino Wool/ 3% LYCRA®</li><li><strong>Care</strong>: Machine wash cold on a delicate cycle, with like colors.

Available in sizes XS to XL, reviewers rave about how they pass the ‘squat’ test and don’t attract pet hair. They provide a smooth appearance throughout the leg area, reducing the appearance of cellulite or unwanted lines or bulges. Also, the smaller opening at the leg means you won’t feel the pant fall down when you’re holding a yoga pose.&nbsp;</p><p>Consider ordering a size up, since reviewers share they run on the smaller side.&nbsp;</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/d44e35c566cbe18abb53fe921f7be606/76902/Icebreaker-Womens-Merino-Fastray-High-Rise-Tights-Gridlines.jpg></span></span><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li><strong>Sizes</strong>: XS-XL</li><li><strong>Rise</strong>: High-rise</li><li><strong>Compression</strong>: Soft and stretchy with a slim fit.</li><li><strong>Material/Fabric</strong>: 76% nylon, 24% spandex</li><li><strong>Care</strong>: Machine wash cold and line dry.

Wear the waistband above or below your bump; it can be folded to your preference.&nbsp;</p><p>They feature a vast collection of colors, so you can coordinate with different tanks, t-shirts, or sweaters. Since pregnancy can cause a hot flash or extra sweat, the moisture-wicking material is especially handy.&nbsp;</p><p>Reviewers say they run a little large, so consider ordering a bit smaller than you typically do.

Also, if you’re used to the compression found in Lululemon traditional tights, be prepared for a different fit in these yoga pants.

This pair, explicitly designed for the studio, features supportive material that doesn’t compress but smooths out your legs and torso. Though it runs on the slimmer side, even curvier figures will appreciate the smart details and cozy, durable and moisture-wicking design. You won’t find pockets in this pair of leggings, but that makes sense since hey, they’re meant for a studio practice.&nbsp;</p><p>Reviews share that these flare yoga pants tend to run a little larger and longer than average, so size down for the perfect fit.</p><p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/fe00937de34810885dd5810b4584196e/44838/lululemon-align-wide-leg-pant.jpg> </span></span>&nbsp;</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li><strong>Sizes</strong>: XS-XL</li><li><strong>Rise</strong>: High-rise</li><li><strong>Compression</strong>: No</li><li><strong>Material/Fabric</strong>: 72% Polyester, 28% Elastane</li><li><strong>Care</strong>: Machine wash cold with like colors and tumble dry.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Durability</strong>: Designed to perform in and out of the class with high-quality materials that move and groove with you.</li><li><strong>Comfort and Fit</strong>: A slim fit with soft fabric that’s also moisture-wicking.</li><li><strong>Ease of Movement</strong>: Stretchy while also offering a smoothing benefit.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Breathability</strong>: Yes</li><li><strong>Pockets</strong>: No</li><li><strong>Price</strong>: $98</li></ul><h3>Best lounge yoga pants: <a class=affiliate-link-link href=# rel=nofollow>Athleta Elation Flare Pant</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best lounge yoga pants</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Athleta Elation Flare Pant</h3></p><p>Athleisure is in a class of its own when it comes to fashion.

With bright hues, smart compression, a very soft material, and an ultra high-rise waistband, you can easily go from the office to the gym to your friend’s couch for Netflix binging, all in one day.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to the soft appeal, Athleta is known for its absorbent, moisture-wicking design. This gives you peace of mind if you work up a sweat during your class.

With these period-proof leggings from Adidas, you can also ease worries of accidental leaks. They feature a specific technology developed by Adidas to provide a no-show additional layer of support against leaks when wearing a cup, tampon or pad. To keep your cramps calmer, low to medium compression is the just-right amount of pressure for comfort. And with a size range from XS to 4X, most people will be able to find an ideal fit. Keep in mind these are on the tighter side for a reason, so they lock in support and catch leaks if they happen. The addition of mesh panels also help you feel cooler faster, right when you need it.&nbsp;</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/b393083886964ce0991ce027ebad29e6/cbeab/Alo-Yoga-High-Waist-Elevation-Mini-Skirt.jpg></span></span><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li><strong>Sizes</strong>: XS-4X</li><li><strong>Rise</strong>: High-rise</li><li><strong>Compression</strong>: Low-to-medium compression.</li><li><strong>Material/Fabric</strong>: 73% recycled polyester, 27% elastane interlock.

Physical therapist and yogi <a href=# rel=nofollow>Dr. Samantha Harte</a> provides this guide to begin the process.</p><ul><li><strong>Try a few stores/retailers</strong>: Whether through recommendations or past experiences with your favorite brand, choose two or three stores with an excellent reputation and prepare to spend time in each.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Test out a few fits</strong>: Try on a bunch of them—high waisted, mid-rise, low-rise, shorts, three-quarter, or full-length.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Remember the purpose</strong>: Dr. Harte says to go off of what feels the best and not what looks the best, as that will inspire you to wear them again and again. Remember the types of movements you’ll be doing in the yoga pants—and test them out. These might include squats, lunges, and so on.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Phone a friend</strong>: Or try them on in front of someone. Dr. Harte says a friend, partner, or even a yoga instructor can help you focus on what’s most important by asking questions, like “How do you feel in those pants?”, “Will you feel comfortable going to your favorite yoga class without worrying if they’ll fall?” and so on.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>What is the best yoga pant length?</h3><p>Since you want to avoid a long tail on your yoga pants that could cause you to slip or fall out of a pose, picking the right length is crucial. According to Dr. Harte, the best way to figure out your yoga pant length is first to decide if you want a flared or tapered bottom.&nbsp;</p><p>“If the pants are flared, it’s best to have them no lower than a sole height, so they don’t interfere with your practice and cause an accidental fall,” she explains. “If they are tapered, though, the options are vast.”&nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately, she adds that the best length comes down to whatever makes you feel the most comfortable and supported so you can get out of your head and into your body.&nbsp;</p><h3>What is the difference between yoga pants and leggings?</h3><p>Yoga pants are designed specifically for the practice of yoga, which is highly versatile and dynamic, Dr. Harte says. “Yoga challenges the body in multiple planes of motion, stretches and strengthens the connective tissue, and often induces a serious sweat,” she explains.</p><p>Leggings, on the other hand, are often form-fitting pants worn out in the world, whether in the workplace or at your favorite brunch spot. “They don’t necessarily handle large ranges of motion or heavy amounts of sweat,” she said. “Because of that, they could end up irritating the skin or ripping if worn in a yoga class. If you’re investing in a yoga practice, it is best to invest in comfortable and supportive attire that matches the demands of the task.”</p><h3>How do you pick the right size yoga pants?</h3><p>To determine the best size yoga pant, Dr. Harte says to start by asking around and reading reviews. “Get as much information as possible from people who have taken a diverse range of yoga classes without constantly pulling the waistline up or returning them because they were see-through or made of cheap material,” she says. “If you’re on the bold side, get in a dressing room and try out some dynamic poses with the pants on and see how you feel."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1lqaS0onnPmqWtq18%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./cards-against-humanity-poop-black-friday.html>&#171;&nbsp;Cards Against Humanity Sends Literal Poop to Thousands for Black Friday</a>
