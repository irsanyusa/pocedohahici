Similar to the ones made for humans, these canine versions look at genetic markers that provide information about breed. Though there are multiple dog DNA test kit brands, quality can vary. In my opinion, as a veterinarian, the top two are clearly Embark and Wisdom Panel. Embark tests over 230,000 genetic markers, which they say is more than twice that of their top competitor, Wisdom Panel. Wisdom Panel says they’re the most accurate for dog breed testing.</p><p>I’ve rounded up several kits by each of them and you can decide which you prefer based on your needs. If you have the means, it could be fun to run a test from each company for personal comparison.</p><h2 id=my-top-picks-for-dog-dna-tests>My top picks for dog DNA tests</h2><h3>Best research-backed dog DNA test Comment end: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Embark Breed + Health Dog DNA Test</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best research-backed dog DNA test</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Embark Breed + Health Dog DNA Test</h3></p><p>Embark’s research partnership with Cornell University’s College of Veterinary Medicine—which is consistently ranked in the top three veterinary colleges in the United States—is a key factor in what makes them a leader in dog DNA test kits.

Some of their competitors offer one or two options for kits (e.g. Basepaws and Ancestry offer one, Koko Genetics offers two). And on both Embark and Wisdom Panel’s websites, it’s easy to find their accuracy information with an actual percentage given.</p><p>Both Embark and Wisdom Panel are also partnered with reputable research organizations: Embark with Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine, and Wisdom Panel with <a rel=nofollow href=#>Morris Animal Foundation</a><a rel=nofollow href=#>, OFA,</a> and others. Both also use human-grade labs. (And I’m not saying that the other companies aren’t partnered with reputable places and don’t use human-grade labs.) Ultimately, the upfront transparency about accuracy—with a stated percentage—was a major factor in why I chose Embark and Wisdom Panel above their competitors.</p><h2 id=what-is-a-dog-dna-test>What is a dog DNA test?</h2><p>Dog DNA tests are a way for pet owners, dog breeders, and veterinarians to learn more about an animal’s genetic makeup. An at-home DNA test kit collects cells from the inside of your dog’s mouth, which are then used to analyze genetic material for information on breed identification, physical traits—like if your dog might experience heavy seasonal shedding—and genetic health risks. (However, positive results for a genetic risk isn’t a diagnosis. More on this later.) You mail the sample to the company and in several weeks, they email you a report.</p><p>There are also DNA tests that can be run on blood, but if your veterinarian orders these, they will draw your pet’s blood and submit the sample to a veterinary genetics laboratory.</p><h2 id=what-to-look-for-in-a-dog-dna-test>What to look for in a dog DNA test</h2><h3>What are the features of the test?</h3><p>Look for a test whose capabilities and focus meet your needs:</p><h4>Are you looking to identify what blend of breeds your rescue pup is?</h4><p>If your primary purpose is breed identification, then you’ll want to know how big the company’s breed database is. For example, <a rel=nofollow href=#>Basepaws</a>’ DNA test kit box says 200+ breeds (though the product description on their website says 300+).</p><h4>Do you have a purebred dog and you want to see if they have genetic markers for certain medical issues?</h4><p>Look for a test that offers either the most genetic disease markers or find a kit that is breed specific. <a rel=nofollow href=#>Orivet</a> offers breeds-specific kits, like a French bulldog kit, a Labrador kit, etc. But keep in mind, a positive result doesn’t automatically mean your pet will get that disease. More on this later.</p><h4>Do you want to learn about your dog’s ancestry or do you want to locate your pup’s siblings or other relatives?</h4><p>Some kits offer ancestry information and the ability to find relatives in their database. Or maybe you’re interested in testing for behavior traits (like hunting-related food motivation) and physical traits like the possible weight range your puppy might fall within as an adult.</p><p>Some companies only offer one dog DNA test kit. Some have several choices ranging from mainly breed identification, screening for breeds and genetic health risks, and screening for various physical traits.</p><h3>How accurate is the test?</h3><p>I’ll go into more detail on accuracy later, but on <a rel=nofollow href=#>Embark</a>’s website a percentage is readily provided on every single product page (99% accuracy). Others, like <a rel=nofollow href=#>Wisdom Pane</a>l, have it in their FAQs section (“at least 99% accuracy”). On some companies’ pages, you can search for accuracy information, click on multiple links, and still not find an actual number, e.g. Basepaws, <a rel=nofollow href=#>Koko Genetics</a>, and <a rel=nofollow href=#>DNA My Dog</a>.</p><h3>How big is their breed database</h3><p>Look for a website that clearly states how big their database is. If you have a mixed breed dog and one or more of their various breeds aren’t in a company’s database, they’re not going to be able to provide you with that information. The database size is usually stated on the box itself but more information can be found on the company website. Some also include testing to determine if your dog is part coyote or wolf.</p><h2 id=why-should-i-try-a-dog-dna-test>Why should I try a dog DNA test?</h2><p>Trying a dog DNA test is helpful if you want to learn more about your dog’s breed makeup, ancestry, behavior, genetic risk factors, and physical traits. Knowing these things can help guide you in offering more informed care for your pet. (Breed and health info can even provide some data points for things like choosing the <a rel=alternate href=#>best dog food for puppies</a> or the <a rel=alternate href=#>best senior dog food</a>.) It’s also a fun way to potentially find some of your dog’s relatives.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>Are dog DNA tests really accurate?</h3><p>This is a debated topic because dog DNA test kits aren’t regulated by the FDA and <a rel=nofollow href=#>experts</a> say there aren’t peer-reviewed publications that evaluate test kit accuracy. So essentially, you have to trust what a company tells you. And some manufacturer’s websites don’t tell you in terms of a percentage how accurate their tests are.</p><p>Other general things to keep in mind regarding accuracy is that a sufficient quantity of sample material is required, which means you need to swab your dog’s mouth for a certain amount of time. For example, Embark specifically prefers 60 seconds and not 30 seconds. Wisdom Panel says 15 seconds. Be sure to follow the manufacturer’s directions on how to swab your dog’s cheek as well as how long to wait after your dog takes medication or eats—including nursing if a dog isn’t weaned—before swabbing.</p><p>Another important factor to consider is that for genetic health screening, a positive result means your dog is at increased risk for that medical issue but it doesn’t tell you the actual probability that your dog will actually ever develop it. That’s not a question that science can answer yet. Since it’s not a diagnosis, discuss your results with a veterinarian or a geneticist at the DNA test kit company in addition to your personal veterinarian. Keep in mind that experience and knowledge about genetic testing varies among private practice veterinarians.</p><p>If your pet doesn’t have any positive results, that doesn’t automatically mean they will never develop medical issues because there isn’t a genetic test for every medical condition.</p><p>Since you’re taking a company’s word for how accurate their test is, my recommendation is to pick a product where that information is openly shared. If you search through their website for 10 minutes and have to sift through scientific jargon and you still haven’t found an answer…my personal preference would be to not buy from them.</p><h3>Why doesn’t my dog look like the breeds on the report?</h3><p>Your dog’s breed report tells you who they are at a DNA level, and that is not all about physical appearance. In fact, <a rel=nofollow href=#>Embark’s website</a> notes that “Less than 1% of a dog’s 20,000 genes impacts appearance.”</p><p>Other things to think about are how many breeds comprise both of your dog’s parents—and their parents, etc? You can’t rely on physical appearance to determine this. To complicate things, multiple genes can affect a single physical trait.</p><p>And of the genes your dog inherited, which ones are actually being expressed? And are dominant genes being expressed or recessive genes? There are also random DNA mutations that can occur, which can affect a dog’s physical appearance.</p><h3>What DNA test do vets use?</h3><p>They often use veterinary genetics laboratories for DNA testing, such as <a rel=nofollow href=#>UC Davis College of Veterinary Medicine</a> or the <a rel=nofollow href=#>University of Pennsylvania’s PennGen Laboratories</a>. Collecting a sample to submit to such a lab can sometimes involve a blood draw, which would be performed at your pet’s veterinary clinic.</p><p>Some veterinarians might also opt to use a cheek swab kit like Embark for Veterinarian DNA Test Kit. This kit provides veterinarians with more thorough information than a retail kit that pet owners can purchase online. Embark also has an online platform for veterinarians needing consultation services.</p><h3>Can dog DNA tell age?</h3><p>Depending on the testing method used, dog DNA can help estimate a dog’s genetic age—which can vary from their chronological age—or it can be used to estimate both. Chronological, or calendar, age is based on when your dog was born. Genetic age—or biological age—is influenced by things like environment, nutrition, and disease. Such factors can cause a dog to be younger or older in terms of genetic age. As such, genetic age can be used to predict longevity. So if a dog (or <a rel=nofollow href=#>person’s</a>) genetic age is younger than their calendar age, theoretically they’ll live longer. If the genetic age is older, a dog’s lifespan will likely be shorter.</p><p>Some dog DNA test kits include genetic age (e.g. DNA My Dog) whereas Embark—who uses a different testing modality that’s considered more accurate—offers a separate Dog Age Test Kit. The methodology that Embark uses is capable of determining both genetic age and calendar age, but the information they provide you with is an estimated range of your dog’s chronological age.</p><p>The two modalities used for estimating genetic age are telomere length and methylation, but the scope of these topics are beyond this article. More information can be found on <a rel=nofollow href=#>Embark’s website</a> and <a rel=nofollow href=#>DNA My Dog’s</a> ‘Questions about the science’ section. Interestingly, these genetic age methodologies have been researched in human medicine as a way to assess the <a rel=nofollow href=#>quality of donor kidneys</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1llKS0brDNmmStnaOpfA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./declaration-de-patrimoine-davantage-delus-locaux-concernes.html>&#171;&nbsp;Dclaration de patrimoine : davantage d'lus locaux concerns</a>
