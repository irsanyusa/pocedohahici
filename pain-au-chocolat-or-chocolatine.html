Even as foreigners, you must know about this famous French chocolate pastry. Everybody goes crazy about it, from children to elderly people. So, what is this discussion that took over the internet all about?</p><p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The French and their love for food</h2><p>One of the biggest <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">French clichés is food</a> and how much we love it. Pastries are a big cultural advertisement for France internationally. That is probably why the&nbsp;pain au&nbsp;chocolat&nbsp;vs&nbsp;chocolatine&nbsp;debate became such a big deal.&nbsp;</p><p>In France, this debate had the same influence as the&nbsp;iPhone&nbsp;vs&nbsp;Android&nbsp;one.&nbsp;That is how culturally important it was for us, French people.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Pain au chocolat&nbsp;vs chocolatine</h2><p>So where’s the difference? Well, here is the thing: there is none! Both names are referring to the same thing: a delicious croissant dough filled with two dark chocolate sticks, that you can usually buy for around 1€. Easy, right? Not really. The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">name of this delicacy</a> changes depending on which French region you’re living in. That is where the debate comes in: between un&nbsp;pain au&nbsp;chocolat&nbsp;and&nbsp;une chocolatine, which one is the right one?</p><p>Chocolatine&nbsp;is mostly used in the south-west of France, while&nbsp;pain au&nbsp;chocolat&nbsp;is used everywhere else. Technically, they are both right, as they refer to the same pastry. But social media and memes joined the battle, separating France and opinions even more.</p><p>French people are usually very opinionated and do not hesitate to rise up against what they don’t agree with. An official&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">survey website</a>&nbsp;has been created for people to vote on and choose what to call this pastry.&nbsp;</p><p>The&nbsp;Bordelais&nbsp;(people living in Bordeaux, a fervent&nbsp;chocolatine&nbsp;supporter) did not hesitate to boycott all&nbsp;pain au chocolat&nbsp;buyers. It wasn’t surprising to find a&nbsp;chocolatine&nbsp;for 1€ next to a 1,50€&nbsp;pain au chocolat. In the same bakery.</p><p>French people are really proud of this pastry and its international fame. Its name became a matter of regional pride and tradition. Even famous chefs joined the debate and shared their point of view.</p><p>However, the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">surveys</a>&nbsp;are pretty clear: 84% of French people call this pastry a&nbsp;pain au chocolat. The remaining 16% are mainly people living in the south-west of France (from Bordeaux to Toulouse). The obvious gap between the two did not help with calming everything down. And so, war had been declared between the&nbsp;pain au chocolat&nbsp;clan and the&nbsp;chocolatine&nbsp;clan.</p><p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What does history have to say about chocolatine?</h2><p>From a historical point of view,&nbsp;chocolatine&nbsp;would be the winner. A lot of research has been done on the subject. They actually went as far as the origin of the pastry, when the&nbsp;Schokoladencroissant&nbsp;was imported by August Zang in Paris during the 19th century. The evolution of the Dutch language and years upon years of people modifying the pronunciation made it so that&nbsp;chocolatine&nbsp;would be the most logical answer.</p><h5 class=wp-block-heading>What about the rest of the world?</h5><p>The French pastry debate took over international media as well, including the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">BBC</a>. Videos and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">documentaries</a>&nbsp;doubled in number to try and explain the new French pastry civil war.&nbsp;</p><p>Surprisingly,&nbsp;chocolatine&nbsp;is mostly used abroad as well. Belgium will mostly use&nbsp;pain au chocolat&nbsp;or&nbsp;couque&nbsp;au&nbsp;chocolat. Quebec, Mexico and Japan all prefer&nbsp;chocolatine. Despite the bloody battle going on in France,&nbsp;chocolatine&nbsp;wins internationally.&nbsp;</p><p>Except in our dear English speaking countries, as they love doing whatever they want. Therefore, they do not buy a&nbsp;pain au&nbsp;chocolat, nor a&nbsp;chocolatine: they buy a&nbsp;chocolate&nbsp;croissant.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Politics vs the chocolate croissant debate</h2><p>If you thought I was joking when I said French people took this debate very seriously, well, you’re seriously wrong. In 2018, students wrote to President Macron to get the term&nbsp;chocolatine&nbsp;a reserved spot in the French dictionary. The President mentioned the debate in a speech and everything escalated until it reached the Parliament. Yes, you read it right.</p><p>A few MPs fought for&nbsp;chocolatine&nbsp;to be acknowledged as an official term. They wished for the pastry to keep its fame and status through its name. According to them, the&nbsp;chocolatine&nbsp;should be representing France abroad and keep a recognisable name so as not to confuse foreigners.</p><p>However, the amendment was rejected, and&nbsp;pain au chocolat&nbsp;will keep on being the mainly used term. I think the most important thing to remember is that, while the debate has been fun, we all know what a&nbsp;Bordelais&nbsp;is referring to when they are asking for a&nbsp;chocolatine. And vice versa.</p><p>Now, you’ve been warned. Next time you come to Paris, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ask for a&nbsp;pain au chocolat</a>. But if you come to Bordeaux, save your 0,50€ and ask for a&nbsp;chocolatine. Calling everything by its right name can definitely help you blend with the crowd and pass yourself off as a local.</p><p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4b9f681ae6c7302b1c9f9d956bd85f17?s=240&d=mm&r=g2x" height=120 width=120 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2>Clarisse Girod-Garufi</h2><p>Clarisse is a 23-year-old language lover, born and raised in beautiful southern France.
