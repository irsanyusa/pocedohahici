New albums from <a href=#>Jennifer Lopez</a>, who released her first album since 2014, This Is Me… Now, in February, and <a href=#>Usher</a>, who hadn't put out an album in five years, have kicked off the year—and there's still so much more to come.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>Beyoncé</a> and <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a>, whose new releases Act II and The Tortured Poets Department arrive in March and April, respectively, will soundtrack the spring. Since announcing the album at the 2024 Grammy Awards, Swift has revealed more information about the <a href=#>song titles, various album covers, and bonus tracks </a>in the leadup to its release.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Just after teasing Act II at the Super Bowl in February, Beyoncé dropped two singles from the upcoming album, "Texas Hold 'Em" and "16 Carriages." "Texas Hold 'Em" topped charts in the U.S., and made history when Beyoncé became the first Black female artist to have a No. 1 country song.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In 2024, we can also expect new music from Shakira, Kacey Musgraves, Dua Lipa, and Sheryl Crow. Music releases are a delicate balance. Artists are known to pull or postpone projects—for example, Nick Minaj’s highly anticipated new album, her first since 2018, was supposed to come out Nov. 17 but didn’t actually <a href=#>release until Dec. 8</a>. Ahead of the new year, Cardi B has released a string of features and two singles, but has not spoken at length about when fans can expect a new album. And pop phenom Dua Lipa released the lead single, “Houdini,” for her upcoming album, out in May.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">While the world waits for more details on the status of albums from their favorite artists, here are some of the most anticipated albums of 2024.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Orquideas, Kali Uchis (Jan. 12)</strong></h2><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Kali Uchis’ Red Moon in Venus, a lush soundscape that fully encapsulates listeners with soft, feathery vocals, was <a href=#>our pick for the best album of 2022</a>. The Colombian singer is gearing up for her second all-Spanish-language project, Orquideas, which is due out at the top of 2024. The lead single, “Muñekita,” was a dembow-forward slamming banger featuring El Alfa, one of the frontmen leading dembow’s crossover to American audiences, and JT from the rap duo City Grils. She’s also released the bolero-inspired song, “Te Mata” and the KAROL G-assisted track, “Labios Mordidos.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Savior, Green Day (Jan. 19)</strong></h2><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Green Day is starting out the year with their 14th album and first in three years, Savior. The beloved punk-rock band began the album rollout with the lead single, “The American Dream is Killing Me,” and has since released two more tracks ahead of the album’s Jan. 19 release—”Look Ma, No Brains!” and “Dilemma.” A stadium tour is set to be making stops across North America with supporting acts like The Smashing Pumpkins, The Linda Lindas and Rancid.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>What Now</strong><strong>, Brittany Howard (Feb. 2)</strong></h2><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Brittany Howard is a powerhouse vocalist who served as the frontwoman of the Alabama Shakes and has since become the star of her own solo career. Her last album, Jaime, was met with critical acclaim and the single, “Stay High" earned Howard a Grammy for Best Rock Song—making it her fifth award. In 2024, she is making a comeback with her second studio album, What Now, releasing a single of the same name ahead of its release.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Coming Home</strong><strong>, Usher (Feb. 11)</strong></h2><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Usher has a lot to look forward to in 2024. Not only is he going to be taking the stage at the Super Bowl Halftime Show, but on the same day, he is releasing his ninth studio album, Coming Home. His recent single, “Good Good” featuring R&B and rap heavyweights, Summer Walker and 21 Savage, garnered praise in 2023, but Usher got real Internet attention this year after he got KeKe Palmer to star in the music video for his song, “Boyfriend.” It was a strategic move after Palmer’s ex-boyfriend publicized his discomfort with her being serenaded by Usher at his Las Vegas residency, which is a routine part of his act. The mononymous singer has ruled the R&B game for so long, so we’re definitely looking forward to seeing what his new album will bring.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>This Is Me… Now</strong><strong>, Jennifer Lopez (Feb. 16)</strong></h2><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The last time Jennifer Lopez released an album was in 2014 and a lot has happened since then. She was engaged to baseball player Alex Rodriguez before the couple broke up in 2021. In 2022, she <a href=#>got back together with Ben Affleck</a>, who served as the main inspiration for her 2002 album, This is Me… Then. Now that the two are back together, she’s releasing a sequel to the album titled, This Is Me… Now. The new music will be accompanied by a film of the same name on Prime Video.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Eternal Sunshine, Ariana Grande (Mar. 8)</h2><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The seventh studio album from Ariana Grande will arrive in March. Titled eternal sunshine in reference to the 2004 film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, the album’s <a href=#>first single, “yes, and?”, released in early January</a>, set the stage for what to expect. The video for the song included a card featuring coordinates to Montauk, New York, the setting of the movie which was a favorite of Grande’s late boyfriend Mac Miller.&nbsp; The two shared a love of the actor Jim Carrey, who starred in the film. In 2013, Miller<a href=#> told Complex</a>, “I love Jim Carrey when he's being serious. He killed this role. Whenever I'm talking to a girl, I always tell them to watch Eternal Sunshine. It cuts deep."</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Bleachers</strong><strong>, Bleachers (Mar. 8)</strong></h2><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">When Jack Antonoff is not busy <a href=#>producing albums</a> with Taylor Swift, Lorde, or Lana Del Rey, he works on music with the band Bleachers, which released its debut album in 2014. Following two more albums, Bleachers will release a fourth self-titled album in 2024.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Deeper Well, Kacey Musgraves (Mar. 15)</h2><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Kacey Musgraves’ Album of the Year win at the <a href=#>2019 Grammy Awards catapulted the country-pop singer to stardom</a>. Golden Hour became a favorite to those who were new to Musgraves, and her 2021 follow-up, star-crossed, kept her fans hooked. Almost three years later, she is returning with a new album called Deeper Well. Musgraves released the somber title track in early February On her fifth album, she worked with her long-time producers and collaborators, Ian Fitchuk and Daniel Tashian.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">World Wide Whack, Tierra Whack (Mar. 15)</h2><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>Tierra Whack</a> is one of the most zany characters in the rap game, but don’t let her vibrant personality distract you from her serious talent. Following her feature onLil Yachty’s “T.D.,” her first album, Whack World, which consists of 15 one-minute tracks, and a few EPs, Whack will release a full LP, World Wide Whack—which she has called her official debut album.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran, Shakira (Mar. 22)</h2><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Over the course of her <a href=#>decades-long career</a>, superstar <a href=#>Shakira</a> holds the record for best-selling female Latin artist in history. The singer has announced that she will be releasing her first album in seven years, Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran. The title seems to come from one of the most notable lines in her juggernaut hit “Shakira: Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 53” with the Argentinian producer and viral hitmaker Bizarrap, where she sings, “las mujeres ya no lloran, las mujeres facturan,” translating to, “women no longer cry, they make money.” According to the newly released tracklist, she has a new song with Bizarrap on the way. The two made magic together last year after he gave Shakira space to sing about her highly-publicized split from her husband Gerard Piqué; she has since been on a journey of reclaiming the narrative, not as a woman scorned, but as an empowered mother who rises above it all. Last year saw <a href=#>multiple hits from Shakira’s collaborations</a> with Colombian superstar Karol G’s “TQG” and her singles “Copa Vacía” with Manuel Turizo and “El Jefe” with Fuerza Regida, all of which are going to be on the album. Also on the tracklist, she has new collaborations with Rauw Alejandro, Cardi B, and Grupo Frontera. The album boasts 16 tracks—eight of which are new—and a Tiësto remix of her viral Bizarrap song.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Tyla, Tyla (Mar. 22)</strong></h2><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Tyla had a huge year with <a href=#>the success of her single, “Water,”</a>&nbsp; which inspired a viral dance craze online.

The LA-based singer whose real name is Lorely Rodriguez, has already released three singles off the album. “Femenine,” “Kiss Me,” featuring British pop-rock darling Rina Sawayama, and “Kiss Me,” a collaboration with the band MUNA. On the album, she sings in both English and Spanish. The title of the album comes from a previous relationship she had with a director who was announcing his “For Your Consideration” campaign for the Oscars. “He took me up on a hill and said he was emotionally unavailable and he kind of broke my heart,” she tells Pitchfork. “That was the gateway for the album and it gave me the opportunity to explore broader themes.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Act II, Beyoncé (Mar. 29)</h2><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>Beyoncé’s Renaissance</a>, referred to as Act I, has prompted speculation about what Acts II and III could be since its release in July 2022. During the Super Bowl, Beyoncé gave a look at Act II when she <a href=#>starred in a Verizon commercial</a>. At the end of the ad, she says, “Okay, they're ready. Drop the new music.” Soon after, Beyoncé dropped a teaser video that on her Instagram that announced a new album, Act II, would be released on Mar. 29. She also released <a href=#>two new country songs</a>, “16 Carriages” and “Texas Hold ‘Em.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Evolution, Sheryl Crow (Mar. 29)</strong></h2><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The music legend doesn’t quit. In 2018, Sheryl Crow said she wouldn’t be releasing any more music after her album that year.

Based on the four singles he’s released so far—”Killing Me,” “Never Ending Song,” “Winner,” and the most recent single, “Lonely Dancers”—Gray is fully leaning into a retro-80s aesthetic for the new record. The newest single heavily samples the 1982 smash hit “Safety Dance” by Men Without Hats and was produced by pop’s biggest hitmaker Max Martin along with ILYA, and Oscar Holter.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Don’t Forget Me, Maggie Rogers (April 12)</h2><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Maggie Rogers has been releasing consistently great music since her debut single “Alaska,” left superstar producer <a href=#>Pharrell Williams speechless</a> when he first heard it in 2016. Since then, she’s released two albums—her debut Heard It In a Past Life, and 2022’s Surrender. For that project, Rogers <a href=#>attended a songwriting camp hosted</a> by none other than prolific singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell and had other famous attendees, including Brandi Carlisle and Harry Styles. With this new album, Rogers wrote in a newsletter posted to her Instagram last week that she worked a majority of the songs with Ian Fitchuk—eight out of the 10 songs—and the last two she “uncovered on [her] own and were the product of [her] long friendship with Lee Foster. She also wrote that in many ways this album feels like a return to form for, inspiring the feelings she felt while making art at 16 years old, saying, “I wanted to make an album that felt like a Sunday afternoon.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">I’m Doing It Again Baby!, Girl in Red (April 12)</h2><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Norwegian singer-songwriter girl in red has become a critical darling of the indie pop world, with her debut 2021 album&nbsp; if i could make it go quiet getting generally positive reviews.

Immediately after getting off-stage, she released the cover art for the album and later released the tracklist, revealing she collaborated with Post Malone and Florence and the Machine.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Radical Optimism, Dua Lipa (May 3)</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Dua Lipa has found a sound that works for her. The pop superstar had a massive hit with the <a href=#>glittery-disco Barbie movie soundtrack single</a>, “Dance The Night.” Now she’s focused on her own music and released <a href=#>“Houdini,”</a> the lead single to her forthcoming third studio album.

It’s impossible not to feel like a bad bitch listening to her music. In 2019, the Alabama rapper found viral fame with her song, “Beef FloMix” and that built the perfect foundation for her first mixtape, 2020’s Ho, why is you here?

Ever since her rise to rap superstardom, the world has been awaiting a new Cardi B record. After taking some time off to focus on her two young kids, Kulture and Wave, the rapper is making her comeback and is set to release her first album in five years following the release of her lead single, the Megan Thee Stallion-assisted “Bongos.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Born in the Wild, Tems (June 7)</strong></h2><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Nigerian singer Tems is on the rise.
