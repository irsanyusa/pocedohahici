I’m writing to&nbsp;you because I’ve found myself in&nbsp;a&nbsp;situation that&nbsp;I never expected, and I’m struggling with the fallout. My&nbsp;wife, Emily, and&nbsp;I have been married for a&nbsp;decade, and we’ve always celebrated our anniversaries with a&nbsp;special trip or&nbsp;a&nbsp;romantic dinner. But this year, something came up&nbsp;that threw all of&nbsp;our plans into chaos, and I’m not sure how to&nbsp;move forward.</p><p>This year was supposed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;special—our tenth anniversary. We&nbsp;had planned a&nbsp;weekend getaway, just the two of&nbsp;us, to&nbsp;celebrate the milestone. Emily had been looking forward to&nbsp;it&nbsp;for months, and&nbsp;I was excited too.<br>But then, a&nbsp;week before our trip, I&nbsp;got a&nbsp;call from my&nbsp;younger sister, Sarah, who lives in&nbsp;a&nbsp;different state. She was expecting her first child, and she was nervous about giving birth alone. Her husband, Mike, is&nbsp;a&nbsp;military officer and was deployed overseas, so&nbsp;she was going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;alone for the birth. Sarah asked if&nbsp;I could be&nbsp;there for her when the baby came, and&nbsp;I knew from the tone of&nbsp;her voice that she really needed&nbsp;me.”</p><p><h2>Tom has decided to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;his sister on&nbsp;his marriage anniversary.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/72a/e20/dc3d4e584e821b1dd225bb5b04.jpg><p>Tom continued, “Sarah and&nbsp;I have always been close. Growing&nbsp;up, it&nbsp;was just the two of&nbsp;us and our mom, and&nbsp;I took on&nbsp;a&nbsp;protective role after our dad passed away. I&nbsp;was there for her through everything—graduations, breakups, her wedding—and I&nbsp;couldn’t imagine not being there for her when she needed me&nbsp;most. So, when she called, I&nbsp;knew&nbsp;I had to&nbsp;go.</p><p>I&nbsp;broke the news to&nbsp;Emily, thinking she would understand, but she didn’t take it&nbsp;well. She got upset as&nbsp;this meant that&nbsp;I would skip the wedding anniversary. She said that our anniversary was important too and that&nbsp;I was choosing my&nbsp;sister over her. I&nbsp;tried to&nbsp;explain that it&nbsp;was just one year, that we&nbsp;could celebrate later, but she was hurt and felt like&nbsp;I was abandoning her. We&nbsp;argued about&nbsp;it, but in&nbsp;the end, I&nbsp;told her that&nbsp;I couldn’t leave Sarah alone at&nbsp;such a&nbsp;critical time and&nbsp;I went anyway.”</p><p><h2>His wife prepared an&nbsp;unpleasant surprise when he&nbsp;got back home.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d1e/da2/0ef0a75ad0a2cbb128931710ab.jpg><p>Tom revealed, “The day of&nbsp;our anniversary came, and instead of&nbsp;being on&nbsp;a&nbsp;romantic getaway with Emily, I&nbsp;was in&nbsp;the delivery room with Sarah, holding her hand as&nbsp;she brought her daughter into the world. It&nbsp;was an&nbsp;incredible moment, and&nbsp;I was grateful to&nbsp;be&nbsp;there for her. But at&nbsp;the same time, I&nbsp;felt a&nbsp;pang of&nbsp;guilt knowing that Emily was at&nbsp;home, probably still angry with&nbsp;me.</p><p>When I&nbsp;got back a&nbsp;week later, I&nbsp;expected the cold shoulder, and maybe a&nbsp;few days of&nbsp;tension, but what&nbsp;I didn’t expect was the way Emily would take her revenge. When I&nbsp;walked into the house, I&nbsp;was shocked to&nbsp;see it&nbsp;completely empty—Emily had packed up&nbsp;and left. There was a&nbsp;note on&nbsp;the kitchen table that said, ’You missed our anniversary. Now, let’s see how it&nbsp;feels when someone you love isn’t there when you need them.’”</p><p><h2>Emily left him completely alone.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f9a/c4c/3f9aeb500083b49dc693eb8eb3.jpg><p>“I&nbsp;was shocked and devastated. I&nbsp;tried calling her, but she wouldn’t pick&nbsp;up. I&nbsp;texted, sent emails, and even went to&nbsp;her best friend’s house, but no&nbsp;one would tell me&nbsp;where she was. I&nbsp;was left alone, not knowing what to&nbsp;do&nbsp;or&nbsp;how to&nbsp;fix things.”</p><p>Tom continued, “After three days of&nbsp;silence, I&nbsp;came home from work to&nbsp;find Emily sitting on&nbsp;the couch. She looked calm, but&nbsp;I could tell she was still hurt. She told me&nbsp;that she needed me&nbsp;to&nbsp;understand how it&nbsp;felt to&nbsp;be&nbsp;left behind, how lonely it&nbsp;was to&nbsp;be&nbsp;ignored on&nbsp;a&nbsp;day that was supposed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;about&nbsp;us. She said she didn’t want to&nbsp;leave me&nbsp;for good, but she needed me&nbsp;to&nbsp;realize how much&nbsp;I had hurt her.”</p><p><h2>Now Tom is&nbsp;upset with how Emily behaved.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/ec1/21d/4ee31655bf9fb8e7582fe8db0f.png><p>“Then, she dropped the twist&nbsp;I never saw coming. Emily told me&nbsp;she had spent those three days staying at&nbsp;a&nbsp;hotel near the hospital where Sarah gave birth. She had been there the whole time, watching from a&nbsp;distance. She even visited Sarah after I&nbsp;left, bringing flowers and congratulating her on&nbsp;the baby.<br>Emily wanted to&nbsp;show me&nbsp;that she wasn’t heartless, that she cared about my&nbsp;family too, but that she was deeply hurt by&nbsp;my&nbsp;decision. She wanted me&nbsp;to&nbsp;feel what it&nbsp;was like to&nbsp;be&nbsp;left out of&nbsp;something important, just like she had been.”</p><p>Tom concluded, “I&nbsp;didn’t know what to&nbsp;say. I&nbsp;was torn between feeling guilty for hurting Emily and being upset that she would go&nbsp;to&nbsp;such lengths to&nbsp;teach me&nbsp;a&nbsp;lesson. It’s been a&nbsp;few weeks since this happened, and while we’ve talked things through, there’s still a&nbsp;distance between&nbsp;us that wasn’t there before.<br>I’m struggling with how to&nbsp;move past this and whether&nbsp;I made the right choice in&nbsp;the first place. Did I&nbsp;really do&nbsp;something so&nbsp;wrong, or&nbsp;was Emily’s reaction too extreme? I’m at&nbsp;a&nbsp;loss, <strong>Bright Side</strong>—what should I&nbsp;do?”</p><p>Special occasions offer a&nbsp;wonderful opportunity for family bonding and joy.
